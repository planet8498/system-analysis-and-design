# system-analysis-and-design
The DriverPass project involved designing a cloud-based system for DriverPass, a company that provides tools to help students prepare for DMV driving exams. The client required a web-accessible platform that allows customers to register, schedule driving lessons, complete online practice tests, and track progress, while also supporting staff roles such as secretaries, administrators, and IT personnel through scheduling, reporting, and system management features.

I did particularly well in analyzing and organizing system requirements and translating them into a clear system design. The business requirements document accurately captured functional and nonfunctional needs, and the system design used UML diagrams to clearly show how users and system components interact.

If I could revise one part of my work, I would expand the detail in the UML sequence diagrams by including additional exception and alternate flows. This would make the design more robust and better prepared for real-world scenarios.

User needs guided every design decision. By identifying distinct user roles and workflows, I ensured the system supported secure access, efficient scheduling, and progress tracking. Considering user needs is critical because systems that align with real workflows are more effective and easier to use.

My approach to software design focuses on understanding the problem first, then applying requirement analysis, use cases, and UML modeling. In future projects, I will continue using these techniques while incorporating early feedback to refine designs.
